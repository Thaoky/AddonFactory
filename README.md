# AddonFactory

This add-on is the core component of my other add-ons (Altoholic, Datastore, and a few unreleased ones).

Key features :

- Event handling: ex: Allows multiple registrations to ADDON_LOADED in multiple files of a project.
- Localizations
- Guild communication
- Add-on key bindings
- Add-on compartment
- Table pool
- Basic OOP + classes for SQL Table, SQL Table View, ...
- Dependency injection
- etc..

It also provides the fundamental templates to make a UI similar to the Auction House in WoW.

Note: the add-on by itself does nothing visible, it is meant to be a dependency that other add-ons rely on.
